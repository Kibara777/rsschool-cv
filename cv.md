Having started my career as a pfotografer and doing this about 5 years i learned
retouching. I’ve mastered different retouching techniques, learned to work with
graphic tablet, become an advanced Photoshop, Premier pro, After effects user.
Done the different project work about multi-camera video montages outsorced.
Then i worked in software tasting and became a QA engineer after working in the
position for about a year. Due to the pandemic situation, I returned to Remote

this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth, besides
there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a

skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend
Developer.
